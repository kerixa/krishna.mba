<h1>The Blind Dodo</h1>
<p>
I hope it is just the two of us who are reading this now.<p> Very long ago, there were birds called the 'dodo' on the Island of Mauritius.<p> Fat birds with a vision to take over the planet.<p> I am a two year old in Mauritius now, after having a Psychotic break-down that happened long ago. Shortly after moving to the small island, I started to like the local dogs very much.<p> I started a very special relationship with one whose name was 'Timmie'.<p> Maybe he is reading this story with me now. Who knows, right? The dodos had a problem.<p> They could not fly. But their ambition for flying, the ambition to take over the planet and whatever that mankind is trying to achieve was the greatest in them. They are on the top of the power animals! But it is very sad that they have all died now. I was just wandering in Mauritius until I realized that there is something big within the country. There is a big creature or entity that is protecting the country from all the unknown entities who are trying to get into the spirit of the island. After 2 years of being in Mauritius, I started seeing dreams about my favourite dog of Mauritius who was in contact with the soul of the only blind dodo who loved Mauritius so much and never wanted to leave. The blind dodo's spirit was beyond imagination of any man and it was formed in a way that could compete with any spirit because of an advantage he had. The dodo hypnosis which is a knowledge taught by Krishna's spirit, one of the good spirits of Mauritius. That was his weapon of manipulation of the bad spirits. This is the end of the story. That blind dodo is reading this story through your eyes. A rush of blood towards his heart, a love for Timmie and the reader of this story will last 'FOREVER'. Now I am reading this story with my eyes closed like a dream!
